Aslida yozishni yaxshi ko'raman lekin asosiy sabab shundaki: fikrlar ko'payib ketdi, lekin ular tartibsiz edi. Chalkash, noaniq va zaif.

Ish qilayotganda ham, dam olayotganda ham. Ba'zida loyiha haqida, ba'zida esa umuman boshqa narsalar haqida. Hammasi aralashib ketardi.

Shunda tushundim - muammo fikrlarning ko'pligida emas ekan. Muammo ularning joyi yo'qligida ekan.

Blog yozishni shuning uchun boshladim. O'rgatish uchun emas. Kimnidir ishontirish uchun ham emas.

Shunchaki fikrlarimni boshimdan olib, joyiga qo'yish uchun yozaman.

Yozganimda hammasi birdan aniq bo'lib ketmaydi. Lekin kamida shovqin kamayadi. Ba'zi savollar o'z-o'zidan joyiga tushadi.

Bu sahifa natija haqida emas. Jarayon haqida.

Eng qizig'i shundaki, yozib bo'lgach, boshim biroz yengillashadi. Demak, foydasi bor ekan. Qolgani vaqt masalasi.

I actually like writing. But the main reason is simple: I had too many thoughts, and they were not organized. They were messy, unclear, and weak.

It happened while working and even while resting. Sometimes I thought about projects, sometimes about completely different things. Everything mixed together.

Then I understood something. The problem was not that I had many thoughts. The problem was that they had no place.

That is why I started this blog. Not to teach. Not to convince anyone.

I write just to take my thoughts out of my head and put them in order.

When I write, everything does not become clear immediately. But at least the noise becomes smaller. Some questions find their place by themselves.

This page is not about results. It is about the process.

The most interesting thing is that after writing, my head feels lighter. So it helps. The rest is a matter of time.
